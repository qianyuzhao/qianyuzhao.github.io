I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), advised by Professors [Kaiyu Guan](http://faculty.nres.illinois.edu/~kaiyuguan/) and [Bin Peng](https://pengbinpeluo.github.io/). My research lies at the intersection of hydrology, water quality modeling, machine learning, and statistical modeling of environmental systems. I aim to develop interpretable, data-driven models to better understand and manage complex environmental processes.

I earned my M.S. degree from the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University, where I was advised by [Prof. Mark Borsuk](https://cee.duke.edu/people/mark-borsuk/). My Master's thesis focused on the detection of aboveground storage tanks using high-resolution satellite imagery and image analysis techniques.

Prior to that, I received my B.S. in Environmental Science from Nankai University. As an undergraduate, I worked in the atmospheric chemistry group led by Prof. Guoliang Shi, where I investigated the formation and behavior of inorganic aerosols. 

My research is motivated by a commitment to addressing pressing environmental and public health challenges. By leveraging advanced computational tools and interdisciplinary approaches, I strive to contribute meaningful, actionable insights to the scientific and policy communities.
